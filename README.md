# poetic-text-generator-ai
Poetic Shakespearean Texts generator using Recurrent Neural Networks in Python

In this AI project, I attempted to build a recurring neural network that generate Shakespearean texts. 
The neural network should be able to generate and produce peotic texts based on a temperature value inputted by the user.

For more information, please read the comments inside the Python file.
